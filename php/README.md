PHP FTP APIs
============

This demonstrates how to connect to the ftp server with PHP. You will need to know your apikey and password which can be found in the UI: API Keys -\> Manage -\> Actions -\> Access Details. Once you have that you can try the main.php file for an upload demo. For example:
<pre>
  <code>
    ./main.php -f test.csv -l /tmp -k TestKey -p e261742d-fe2f-4569-95e6-312689d04903 --poll 10
  </code>
</pre>
The CLI is described in more detail with <code>./main.php --help</code>

It is recommended to require the Operations file and use the methods in there to customize your process. The methods are described in file. If you want to cut down on code, this file only requires the files in patched_pemftp.
