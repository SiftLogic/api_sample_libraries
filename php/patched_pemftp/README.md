Patched PemFtp
==============
Unlike using the ftp builtins in PHP, with this library, we can extract the reponse messages from the server and then act on them. The patched version (updated mainly by a previous developer) fixes a couple of bugs and adds the last_message function to be able to parse responses from the server.

The original code is available at [http://www.phpclasses.org/package/1743-PHP-FTP-client-in-pure-PHP.html](http://www.phpclasses.org/package/1743-PHP-FTP-client-in-pure-PHP.html). The License is LGPL.
