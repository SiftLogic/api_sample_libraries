Each implementation is contained within an evironment folder which describes the implementation in more detail. Currently, there are 6 planned environments:

* .Net
* Java
* Node.js (make run-node) ✔
* PHP (make run-php) ✔
* Python
* Ruby

test_data.csv is an example file that can be run for each test. Specifically, the make run tests in this folder use this file.
