SiftLogic FTP APIs
==================

Each implementation is contained within an evironment folder which describes the implementation in more detail. Currently, there are 6 planned environments:

* .Net (no linux run, see dotnet/README.md) ✔
* Java
* Node.js (<code>make run-node</code>) ✔
* PHP (<code>make run-php</code>) ✔
* Python
* Ruby

*test_data.csv* is an example file that can be run for each test. Specifically, the make run tests in this folder use this file.
